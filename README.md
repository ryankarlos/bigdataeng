# Big Data Engineering Tasks

If running the scripts locally, we will install poetry and configure virtual environment for
dependencies.  This will install the dependencies with the same versions as specified in the poetry.lock file
A python version above 3.8.1 or less than 3.10 is required.

```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install poetry -U
poetry install
```

Further instructions can be found in the poetry documentation https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/.
Alternatively, the required dependencies can be installed via another env manager e.g.
venv https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html or conda https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/software/conda.html#creating-a-conda-virtual-environment-with-anaconda


The `src` folder contains tasks 1,2 and 3 which contain README.md with descriptions on the tasks and solution.
